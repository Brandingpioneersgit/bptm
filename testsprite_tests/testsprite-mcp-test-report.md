## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Requirement Validation Summary

### Requirement: User Authentication System
- **Description:** Unified authentication system using Supabase for user login, session management, and role-based access control with support for multiple user roles.

#### Test 1
- **Test ID:** TC001
- **Test Name:** Successful login with valid credentials
- **Test Code:** [TC001_Successful_login_with_valid_credentials.py](./TC001_Successful_login_with_valid_credentials.py)
- **Test Error:** Test failed due to missing logout functionality and multiple backend API errors (404/400), as well as an invalid regex pattern for phone number validation. These issues prevent proper role switching, data loading, and complete login flow verification.
- **Test Visualization and Result:** [View Test Results](https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/mcp/tests/8d779265-fae7-437d-bc91-a8651841a76e/884ec3f2-7f75-4e15-8fde-0d72ac1b6c7b)
- **Status:** ‚ùå Failed
- **Severity:** HIGH
- **Analysis / Findings:** Login works for SEO role user 'John' but logout functionality is missing. Multiple backend API errors (404/400) and invalid phone number regex pattern prevent complete authentication flow testing. Backend schema relationships need fixing, especially 'submissions' to 'employees' foreign key relationship.

#### Test 2
- **Test ID:** TC002
- **Test Name:** Login failure with invalid credentials
- **Test Code:** [TC002_Login_failure_with_invalid_credentials.py](./TC002_Login_failure_with_invalid_credentials.py)
- **Test Error:** N/A
- **Test Visualization and Result:** [View Test Results](https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/mcp/tests/8d779265-fae7-437d-bc91-a8651841a76e/f000964f-1fea-4a75-90df-49a6fe13c274)
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Passed
- **Severity:** LOW
- **Analysis / Findings:** Login form correctly rejects invalid username/email or password inputs and displays proper error messages. Functionality is working as expected. Recommend enhancing error message clarity and adding retry delays to mitigate brute force attempts.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Recommendations

1. **Fix Authentication Issues First** - Resolve regex pattern, backend API endpoints, and database schema problems
2. **Implement Missing Logout Functionality** - Critical for role-based testing
3. **Enforce Payment Proof Validation** - Prevent status updates without mandatory proof URLs
4. **Fix UI Interaction Issues** - Ensure all form buttons are properly rendered and interactive
5. **Provide Valid Test Credentials** - Create test users for all roles to enable comprehensive testing
6. **Database Schema Review** - Fix foreign key relationships and missing columns
7. **API Endpoint Audit** - Ensure all required endpoints are available and properly configured

Once these critical issues are resolved, re-run the TestSprite test suite to validate fixes and achieve higher test coverage.
